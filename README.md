#Square Art 

This is a little project that I created to learn more about the <a href="http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/">Python Imaging Library</a>.

I love the idea of separating an item into its components and seeing how they contribute to the whole. This project is an extension of that, and shows the viewer how the RGB bands affect what you see in these renowned pieces of modern art.

Examples below:
